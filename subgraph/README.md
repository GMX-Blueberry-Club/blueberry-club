GBC Distributor

Hello Berries, several changes based on some feedback we've received

Thé GBC team create events named tournament.
To each tournament a bunch of user get free trade from GBC holders
The users which have free trade can choose between delegate trade to another user or delegate the trade to themselves
Once delegated the user which deposit win a proportional amount from profit of the trader minus a little fee taked by the trader
If the trader didn’t used the funds before the end of the tournament all the funds are returned to the treasury
